# Hey, I'm Carl! 👋

**MSc in Computational Physics** specialized in computational modeling and simulation of complex physical systems. I'm passionate about developing scientific software for sustainability-focused projects 🌍.

During my studies, I've simulated a great variety of systems - from forest ecosystems 🌲 to black holes 🕳️ - and developed expertise in data science 📊 and machine learning applications in physics and healthcare. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me producing or playing music 🎵.

## What I work with

**Languages:** Python, C++, C#, JavaScript

**Tools:** LaTeX, Git, CMake, Bash


## My projects

### 🌳 [Forest Ecosystem Stability](link-to-repo) 
My master's thesis - simulating when forests might suddenly die off and how to predict it early.

### 🕳️ [Black Hole Orbits](link-to-repo)
Bachelor's project where I simulated binary black holes using Einstein's gravity equations.

### 🏥 [Medical Machine Learning]
Helping doctors predict patient complications better (collaboration between Rigshospitalet and the University of Copenhagen).
*For reasons of confidentiality and patient data security, as stipulated by the NDA, the code for the ward project is not publicly available.*
